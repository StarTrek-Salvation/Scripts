I’m thinking about an experimental ship (USS Salvation) 
with a new warp drive that compresses time as well as space to break the warp 10 barrier, 
but (surprise) something goes wrong and it’s flung X years into the future into a point in time 
where the federation has been invaded by some sort of alien,
most home worlds (apart from earth?) have been destroyed 
and star fleet is a few ships struggling to survive and totally outgunned. 
but of course salvation is undamaged, totally provisioned and ready to kick ass… 
but X years out of date



Person introducing cassie to the ship on the shuttle ride is the chief engineer
