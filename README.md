# Star Trek - Salvation

These documents outline the structure of the project code named 'Star Trek - Salvation'.

**What is Star Trek - Salvation?**

'Star Trek - Salvation' is a fan-fiction based around the popular tv series 'Star Trek', created by Gene Roddenbury and produced by Paramount.

More than that, 'Star Trek - Salvation' is also an experiment in open source collaborative creative writing.

**What is open source collaborative writing?**

For many years computer software has benefited from the concepts around open source.  The core idea of open source is that people, skilled and unskilled, 
contribute their time to work on a common project for no reason other than it excites them, or makes their lives better in some way. 

Software developers know how to create software and so, to help them work together and share their skills, they created tools that allows a massively scalable and consitant approach to 
collaborative software development.

The current most popular approach to collaborative software development is software named git and the most popular host
to share your software is currently GitHub.  

It is the hope of the 'Star Trek - Salvation' team to experiment with using these tools to write collabartiviely with other people excited by a common idea - to produce a better story than a few people alone could.

Additionally, through the use of these tools we hope to see whether they are appropriate for collaborative creative writing, or if something needs to be created specifically towards the needs of creative writers.  

**Tell me about the approach of the story**

There are many things unique to the Star Trek mythos, which is why it has been so popular over so many years.  The team wishes to keep this intact but also bring the series up to date with modern audiences.

We have been excited by modern stories (such as the reboot of Battlestar Galactica, Stargate Universe, etc) and want to bring some of that feel into the Star Trek universe.

Star Trek was always about the hopes of mankind for the future, the breaking down of barriers and thinking on what it truely means to be human.  

We hope our stories further this and that the original creaters would be happy that what we create is true to their visions for future of the Star Trek universe and the whole of humanity. 

**How can I get involved?**

We believe that the best way to get a writing project organised is to have a few core creaters 
that define the outline of the story, the principal characters and the basic concepts (the 'feel') of the whole thing.

This is a belief that could be changed throughout the project, but it is where we wish to start it.  

The best way to get involved is to read what we have so far and the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) document which details the process for submitting changes.

After that, have a look at the issues marked as `up-for-grabs`.  These are simple, starter, things that help you get to know how the project works.

If none of those appeal to you then you could contribute your ideas to the outline of a particular story and if your ideas are good we could ask you to write that part of the story.

Of course, you could just contribute a completly written story but don't expect us to take it all and accept it verbatim - it might not fit with the story arcs we wish to have.

**Great, but I'm not a good writer!**

As with open source software there are many things that people who think of themselves as "uncreative" can do the help the project.

The simplist is spelling and grammar checks but you could also give your opinion on how something "feels" to you as someone reading it.

Writers always forget about cannon and conistency at some point, so if you notice something we have missed then please let us know.

If you think you're not a good writer but want to contribute something else creative to the project then please do so. 

For example, concept art helps inspire people and lets everyone know their work is touching people. 

**Great, but I'm not a software developer!**

The tools for contributing can be as simple or as complex as your skills allow.

For a basic introduction to using GitHub for Windows see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md)

If you really are struggling then contact one of the contributors and they will be happy to help. 

This helps us know how appropriate the tools and techniques aimed towards software development are, so please don't hesitate.

Please don't log issues in GitHub about your problems contributing.  

**Where do you see this project going in the future?**

At the end of this project it is hoped that three aims will be accomplished

1. A full 'season' of 'Star Trek - Salvation'.  25 individual stories with a continuous story arc.
2. An understanding of the appropiateness of these tools towards collabartive writing and where to go to improve the usefulness of the tools
3. A licence appropriate to open source collaborative creative writing.   

**What licence are these works under?**

The initiators of this project have no commerical aim, however as it is an experiment in open source collaborative creative writing it will be treated as if there was.

It is the hope to create, along side the creative works, a licence that benefits all contributors if a commerical agreement is reached. 

This licence itself is part of the project and available for contribution as with everything else.
If there is a change to be made to the licence then it must be agreed to by all contributors of the project before merging that change into the licence.
