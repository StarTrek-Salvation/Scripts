#Introduction

This is our pilot season of Star Trek - Salvation.  It's where we introduce the
characters and create the world.

We should have a pilot that lets us have a glimpse into each of our main character's
and also sets up the main story arc for the rest of the season.

#Pilot

##Episode 1
During the pilot Lt Cdr Cassandra (Cassie) Hayle is given command of the USS Salvation, 
an experimental temporal warp ship on its maiden voyage, after the current commander is
unable to perform his duties.  Cassie reluctantly takes command and sets off.  The first
test seems to fail, and so they try again.  During the second test their ship's computer reports
that it is spinning uncontrollably - they can't reconcile this with the inertial dampers.

Cassie pulls the plug on the temporal warp drive and they emerge, shaken and damaged... into
the middle of a fire-fight between a federation vessel and an unknown enemy.  The federation
vessel request their aid, which they provide - destroying the alien vessel by cannibalising their
temporal warp drive.

Cassie invites the Federation commander onboard and they have a conversation in which the commander
reveals that the Salvation was not spinning through space but through time, and they are now 50 years
in the future having destroyed their only way back home.
