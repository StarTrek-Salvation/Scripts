We need to explain about the drive before it sets off
Do we need to bring in the First Officer during the drive scenes to give her more depth
	Same with the other senior crew.  We need to see something of them before the Cortana battle scene
Bring in the lesson Cassie learnt at the start into the first fight with the enemies
I need to dispose of Hamilton and his crew or I'll just have a Voyager rip off
	This isn't Voyager.  They aren't alone. You can just pass them off to what's left of the Federation.
